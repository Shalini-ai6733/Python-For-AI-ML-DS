    "# FUNCTIONS\n",
    "## Definition & Core idea\n",
    "A Function is a named, self-contained block of logic that accepts inputs, does a well-defined task and (optionally) returns a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose:\n",
    "Encapsulate behaviour so you reuse, test and reason about it independent\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why functions matter?\n",
    "1. Remove duplication : Write once and call the function multiple times\n",
    "2. Make programs readle, a well-named function documents intent.\n",
    "3. Enable testing: Small units are easier to unit test.\n",
    "4. Support composition: Complex behaviour built by combining small functions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Anatomy of a function:\n",
    "1. Name: choose descriptive, verb-oriented names(eg: compute_average)\n",
    "2. Parameters(inputs): The data the function needs. Can be required or optional\n",
    "3. Body: The operations/transformations performed\n",
    "4. Return Value(s): what the caller receives, could be a single value or a structured result\n",
    "5. Side effects: any external changes (printing, writing files, mutating globals). Prefer to minimize side effects for pure logic\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parameter style & flexibility \n",
    "1. Positional vs. Keyword arguments: Allow clearer calls and default values\n",
    "2. Positional arguments are assigned by order\n",
    "3. *args (Arbitrary Positional Arguments) (*args) - collects extra positional arguments into a tuple\n",
    "4. (**kwargs) (Arbitrary Keyword Arguments) - collects extra named arguments in to a Dictionary\n",
    "5. Keyword arguments - These allow you to ignore the order by explicitily naming the parameter. This makes your code readable\n",
    "   - Keyword argumemnt must come AFTER POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Rule oF Priority(THE NAPA RULE)\n",
    "- The Order:\n",
    "- 1. Standard Positional arguments\n",
    "  2. *args\n",
    "  3. Keyword Arguments\n",
    "  4. **kwargs\n",
    "\n",
    "# Control flow inside functions \n",
    "1. use LOOPS/Conditionals to express logic : keep complexity low\n",
    "2. For complex tasks: split into smaller helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Where functions fit in ML pipelines?\n",
    "1. Build small, composable steps: Load_data(), clean_data(), compute_features(), score_model()\n",
    "2. Keep transformations pure.I/O (saving, logging) can be isolated to wrapper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quick Checklist while creating a function \n",
    "1. Is the name descriptive?\n",
    "2. Does it have a single responsibility?\n",
    "3. Are inputs/outputs clear?\n",
    "4. Is behaviour documented and tested?\n",
    "5. Does it avoid unnecessary side effects?\n"

    "# OOPs in Python\n",
    "Two ways of programming in Python:\n",
    "1) Procedural Programming,\n",
    "2) OOPs\n",
    "\n",
    "OOPs: Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "A way of organizing code by creating \"blueprints\" (called classes) to represent real-world\n",
    "things like a student, car, or house. These blueprints help you create objects (individual\n",
    "examples of those things) and define their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
    "It defines the properties (attributes) & actions/behaviors (methods) that objects of this\n",
    "type will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object: An object is a specific instance of a class.\n",
    "It has actual data based on the blueprint defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why OOPs?\n",
    "• Models Real-World Problems:\n",
    "Mimics real-world entities for easier understanding.\n",
    "• Code Reusability:\n",
    "Encourages reusable, modular, and organized code.\n",
    "• Easier Maintenance:\n",
    "OOP organizes code into small, manageable parts (classes and objects). Changes in\n",
    "one part don’t impact others, making it easier to maintain.\n",
    "• Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation protects data integrity and privacy by bundling data and methods\n",
    "within objects.\n",
    "• Flexibility & Scalability:\n",
    "OOP makes it easier to add new features without affecting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attributes and Methods\n",
    "Attributes: Variables that hold data about the object.\n",
    "Methods: Functions defined inside a class that describe its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The __init__ Method (Constructor)\n",
    "Whenever we create/construct an object of a class, there is an inbuilt method __init__\n",
    "which is automatically called to initialize attributes.\n",
    "The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to\n",
    "access variables that belong to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction in Python: Hiding unnecessary details\n",
    "Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only the relevant functionality to the\n",
    "user.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation in Python: Restricting direct access to attributes & methods\n",
    "Encapsulation restricts access to certain attributes or methods to protect the data and\n",
    "enforce controlled access.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance in Python: Reusing Parent’s prop & methods\n",
    "Inheritance (parent-child), allows one class (child) to reuse the properties and methods of\n",
    "another class (parent). This avoids duplication and helps in code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism in Python: Same method but different output\n",
    "Polymorphism allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave\n",
    "differently depending on the object.\n"
